## Permission Change Hands On ##

cat <<EOL > Permission.txt
Each of the three "rwx" characters refers to a different operation you can perform on the file.

The 'r' means you can "read" the file's contents.

The 'w' means you can "write", or modify the file's contents.

The 'x' means you can "execute" the file. This permission is given only if the file is a program.

If any of the "rwx" characters are replaced by a '-', then that permission has been revoked.

## Shell Factorial ##

        echo $(($1 * prev))

# Read input from the user
echo "Enter a number:"
read number

# Check if the input is a valid positive integer
if ! [[ "$number" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer."
    exit 1

# Calculate the factorial
result=$(factorial $number)

# Display the result
echo "The factorial of $number is $result"
